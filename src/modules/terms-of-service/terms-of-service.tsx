        <h3>What is Aquachilling?</h3>
        <p>
          Aquachilling is a role playing game built on the Optimism Network. In order to play our game, you need to own
          a Aquachilling NFT. The Aquachilling NFTs are governed by the Aquachilling NFT terms located at
          Aquachilling.com (“Aquachilling NFT Terms”).
        </p>

        <h3>Aquachilling and In-Game Digital Assets</h3>
        <h4>Aquachilling and In-Game Digital Assets: </h4>
        <p>
          As part of your use of the Service, you may earn or obtain $AQUA, a digital token that may be used only on the
          Service, including by completing certain tasks (e.g.,
          <span className='important'> a quest or crafting certain goods</span>), and you may exchange your $AQUA for
          in-game abilities, items or other non-fungible digital assets (collectively, “In-Game Digital Assets”) that
          may be used and traded, subject to these Terms of Service or additional applicable terms
        </p>
        <h4>In-Game Digital Assets </h4>
        <p>
          In-Game Digital Assets may also be purchased directly through the Service via fiat or crypto payments.
          MetaMask and other electronic wallets may allow you to purchase (either directly via Coinbase or via third
          party sites), store, and engage in transactions using cryptocurrency. Transactions may require the payment of
          a transaction fee (“Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the network. You will need to pay a Gas Fee
          for each transaction that occurs via MetaMask or any other similar third party company that provides an
          electronic wallet. Aquachilling neither owns nor controls Metamask, Coinbase or any third party company,
          product or service that you may access, visit, or use. Aquachilling will have no access or control over these
          payments or transactions, or ability to reverse any payments or transactions. Aquachilling will be not liable
          for acts or omissions of Metamask, Coinbase, or any other such third parties, nor will Aquachilling be liable
          for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interactions with any such
          third parties. You may be able to use the Services or other compatible wallet to send and receive any NFT or
          In-Game Digital Asset with other users of the Service. Aquachilling does not offer any user the ability to
          exchange one form of currency for any other form of currency (fiat or digital). In-Game Digital Assets have no
          cash value. In-Game Digital Assets that you earn for in-game participation and that you do not purchase are
          provided for loyalty, award, and promotional purposes only.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aquachilling cannot ensure that any transaction details a user submits via the Services will be confirmed or
          processed on the blockchain. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction details submitted by you via the
          Services may not be completed or may be delayed by any blockchain used to process the transaction.
          Aquachilling does not guarantee that the Services can transfer title or right in any NFT or In-Game Digital
          Asset, and Aquachilling makes no warranties of title of any kind. Once transaction details have been submitted
          to the blockchain, Aquachilling cannot assist you with canceling or otherwise modify such transaction or
          details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ownership of In-Game Digital Assets is mediated by smart contracts and the blockchain. While you own In-Game
          Digital Assets, your rights to the artwork or content associated with the In-Game Digital Assets (“In-Game
          Content”) are licensed to you as set forth below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms of Service, Aquachilling grants you a worldwide,
          royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the In-Game Content associated with your In-Game Digital Assets
          for so long as you own the applicable In-Game Digital Assets, solely for the following purposes:{' '}
          <ol>
            <li> your use of the Service;</li>
            <li>
              as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your In-Game Digital Asset, provided that
              the marketplace cryptographically verifies each In-Game Digital Asset owner’s rights to display the
              corresponding In-Game Content to ensure that only the actual owner can display such In-Game Content; or
            </li>
            <li>
              as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation
              of your In-Game Digital Assets, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each
              In-Game Digital Asset owner’s rights to display the corresponding In-Game Content, and provided that such
              In-Game Content is no longer visible once the owner of such In-Game Digital Asset leaves the
              website/application.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you make your In-Game Digital Assets available to other users hereunder, you acknowledge and accept that
          such In-Game Digital Assets shall be governed by these Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may limit, modify, revalue, or make $AQUA more or less common, valuable, effective, or functional and may
          also change, at any time, potential In-Game Digital Assets on the Service or the requirements to earn such
          In-Game Digital Assets. In-Game Digital Assets may have limited supplies or may be offered for a limited
          period. We may, in our sole discretion, substitute In-Game Digital Assets with other In-Game Digital Assets of
          equal or greater value. You agree to comply with all requirements associated with In-Game Digital Assets,
          including any third party terms that may apply to the redemption, activation, or use of such In-Game Digital
          Assets. $AQUA and In-Game Digital Assets are intended to be redeemed only on the Service. You understand $AQUA
          is not currency, is not intended to substitute for currency, and cannot be used to purchase goods or services
          from other merchants. You are solely responsible for redeeming any $AQUA or In-Game Digital Assets within the
          time specified in your account or on the Service, and we are not responsible for your inability to use or
          derive benefit from any $AQUA or In-Game Digital Assets. You are solely responsible for paying any applicable
          taxes related to $AQUA or In-Game Digital Assets that you acquire. No credit or reversal of any $AQUA or
          In-Game Digital Assets will be provided once the $AQUA or In-Game Digital Assets are redeemed.
        </p>
        <h4>Virtual Items: </h4>
        <p>
          Virtual Items: In using our Service you may purchase, through our supported payment method(s), a limited,
          non-sublicensable, revocable right to use (a) $AQUA or Digital assets (or other forms of in-game credits
          Aquachilling may issue from time to time) for your use with our Services; (b) virtual in-application items,
          content or features; and (c) other goods or services provided by Aquachilling (collectively “Virtual Items ”).
          You are only allowed to purchase Virtual Items from us or our authorized partners through the Service, and not
          in any other way. You must be 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your state), or obtain permission
          from your parent or legal guardian to purchase Virtual Items and provide proof of such consent to us upon our
          request. Virtual Items have no cash value and are not redeemable for cash. Virtual Items that you do not
          purchase but may be awarded to you for in-game participation or otherwise, are provided for loyalty, award, or
          promotional purposes only.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aquachilling may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without
          notice; however, your <span className='important'> Virtual Items </span>may not expire within 5 years from the
          date of purchase or such longer period as required by applicable law. Aquachilling shall have no liability to
          you or any third party in the event that Aquachilling exercises any such rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aquachilling may limit, in its sole discretion, the amount of Virtual Items you may purchase in any
          transaction or in the aggregate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use or transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited except where expressly authorized in the Service. Other
          than as expressly authorized in the Service, you shall not sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise transfer
          Virtual Items to any person or entity or attempt any of the aforesaid, including but not limited to
          Aquachilling, another user or any third party.
        </p>
        <p className='upper'>
          ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.
        </p>
        <p>
          The provision of Virtual Items is strictly for your personal, non-commercial use in Aquachillinggames. This is
          a service provided by Aquachilling that commences immediately upon acceptance by Aquachilling of your
          purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an Account registered by you.
          Aquachilling may revise the pricing for the Virtual Items offered through the Service at any time. YOU
          ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, Aquachilling IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY
          REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS
          CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.
        </p>
        <h4>Blockchain Transaction Fees: </h4>
        <p>
          The delivery and receipt of any In-Game Asset through the Services may be subject to network or transaction
          fees charged by the blockchain (“Blockchain Transaction Fees”), which are non-refundable. Blockchain
          Transaction Fees are paid to emit, record, verify, and process a transaction on the blockchain. Any withdrawal
          or transfer of an In-Game Asset is subject to Blockchain Transaction Fees.
        </p>
        <h4>Risk Assumption: </h4>
        <p>
          You accept and acknowledge each of the following:
          <ol>
            <li>
              To the extent that you sell your Aquachilling NFT, please be aware that the prices of NFTs are extremely
              volatile and these fluctuations might impact the price of your Aquachilling NFT positively or negatively.
              Given the volatility, any In-Game Digital Assets should not be considered an investment. You assume all
              risks in that connection.
            </li>
            <li>
              You assume all risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the
              risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the
              risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet.
            </li>
            <li>
              NFTs, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are relatively new and the regulatory landscape is
              unsettled. New regulations could negatively impact such technologies impacting the value for your In-Game
              Digital Assets. You understand and accept all risk in that regard. d) You assume all responsibility for
              any adverse effects of disruptions or other issues impacting any blockchain or its platform
            </li>
            <li>
              In-Game Digital Assets are not considered legal tender, are not issued or backed by any government, and
              have fewer regulatory protections than traditional currency. Moreover In-Game Digital Assets are not
              insured against theft or loss by any insurance corporation or any investor protection, including the
              Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.

        <h4>Termination</h4>
        <p>

          grounds for termination of your use of the Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement
          authorities. Aquachilling may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service,
          or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service
          under any provision of these Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree

        <p>
          You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the
          Service, and Aquachilling will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Aquachilling reserves
          the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user
          of the Service.
        </p>
        <h4>General</h4>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service (together with the terms incorporated by reference herein) constitute the entire
          agreement between you and Aquachilling governing your access and use of the Service, and supersede any prior
          agreements between you and Aquachilling with respect to the Service. In the event of any conflict between
          these Terms of Service and the Aquachilling NFT Terms in relation to the Service, these Terms of Service will
          control. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use Third-Party
          Services, third-party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of
          the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or
          claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Aquachilling submit to the personal and
          exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Palo Alto, California. The failure of
          Aquachilling to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a
          waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent
          jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to
          the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service
          remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or
          cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within
          one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of these Terms
          of Service and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative
          proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same
          conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You
          may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Aquachilling, but Aquachilling may
          assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in
          these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As used in these
          Terms of Service, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms
          of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” Notices to you may
          be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these
          Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.
          Aquachilling will not be in default hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its
          obligations where such failure or delay is due to civil disturbances, riot, epidemic, hostilities, war,
          terrorist attack, embargo, natural disaster, acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage, fluctuations or
          unavailability of electrical power, network access or equipment, or any other circumstances or causes beyond
          Aquachilling’s reasonable control.
